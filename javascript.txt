    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. Initially designed for enhancing web page interactivity by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) on the client side, JavaScript has evolved to also support server-side development through platforms like Node.js. With a syntax similar to Java and C, it employs dynamic typing and supports various data types. JavaScript’s features include functions as first-class citizens, asynchronous programming capabilities, and extensive libraries/frameworks such as React and Angular. It is supported by major browsers and plays a crucial role in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.

    VARIABLES
    var variableName = ‘value’; // mutable
    let variableName = ‘value’; // mutable
    const constantName = ‘value’; // immutable

    Data types
    let number = 42;
    let string = ‘Hello, World!’;
    let boolean = true;
    let array = [1, 2, 3];
    let object = { key: ‘value’ };

    OPERATORS
    let sum = 2 + 3;
    let difference = 5–2;
    let product = 4 * 6;
    let quotient = 8 / 2;

    COMPARISON OPERATORS
    let isEqual = 5 === ‘5’;
    let isNotEqual = 10 !== 5;
    let greaterThan = 7 > 3;
    let lessThan = 2 < 4;

    CONDITIONALS
    if (condition) {
    // code to execute if the condition is true
    } else if (anotherCondition) {
    // code to execute if another condition is true
    } else {
    // code to execute if no conditions are true
    }

    LOOPS
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // code to repeat 5 times
    }

    while (condition) {
    // code to repeat as long as the condition is true
    }

    FUNCTIONS
    function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // code to execute
    return result; // optional
    }

    ARRAY METHODS
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    numbers.push(6); // add element to the end
    numbers.pop(); // remove element from the end
    numbers.shift(); // remove element from the beginning
    numbers.unshift(0); // add element to the beginning
    numbers.splice(2, 1); // remove 1 element at index 2

    OBJECTS
    let person = {
    name: ‘John’,
    age: 30,
    address: {
    city: ‘New York’,
    zip: ‘10001’
    },
    sayHello: function() {
    console.log(‘Hello!’);
    }
    };

    EVENTS
    element.addEventListener(‘click’, function() {
    // code to execute on click
    });

    ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT
    setTimeout(function() {
    // code to execute after a delay
    }, 1000);

    fetch(‘https://api.example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
    // code to handle the fetched data
    })
    .catch(error => {
    console.error(‘Error:’, error);
    });
