JavaScript supports several types of loops, which are control flow structures that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. Here are the main types of loops in JavaScript:

1. for Loop

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  

2. while Loop

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

3. do while Loop

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
